Technically, the data is transferred to the blockchain from the pawn shops accounting system or Custody Bot send it automatically. After the pawnshop Operator/Custody Bot evaluates the customer's product and enters it into the pawnshop's database, the relevant information is recorded in the blockchain. In order to use network, pawnshops pay a commission for transactions, part of these commissions are received by the holders of MNTP tokens for storing data and participating in transaction verification. The reward is paid in an internal system in GOLD coins. To get the reward, token holders must launch the Master Node of the MINT blockchain – at least 10,000 MNTP tokens are needed.",
